  <h1>CustomAttribute and CompositionEngine issue.</h1>
  <p>This app showcase an issue that I'm currently facing when using customAttribute inside a view dynamically loaded from the compositionEngine.compose() api.</h1>
  <p>Below are a few different ways to load the same ViewModel (Hello). In its view there is a simple custom attribute (make-me-red) that set the paragraph color to red.</p>
  <p>The customAttribute <strong>doesn't work</strong> when the view is loaded from the <strong>composition engine.</strong></p>
  <section>
    <h2>1. Loading with &lt;hello&gt; tag works normally</h2>
    <hello></hello>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>2. Loading with &lt;compose&gt; tag works as well</h2>
    <compose view-model="resources/hello"></compose>
    <small>I am the host</small>

    <h2>3. Composition Engine (like drawer)</h2>
